# Dotnet CQRS REPR pattern CRUD Templates

Auto-generates basic CRUD endpoints and (eventually) Commands/Queries. This project currently only works for my [Dotnet 8 CQRS Template project](https://github.com/AJax2012/Dotnet-8-CQRS-Template), but once this is done, feel free to fork and adjust your paths and file templates according to your desires.

## Usage

Currently, uses my local path, but eventually, will be a dotnet tool. Should be able to type `dotnet generateEndpointTemplates` in the desired directory and follow the instructions in your termainal. For a dry run to see your file output, run `dotnet generateEndpointTemplates -u`.
